## Blurry apps

**Reasons**
Read this first: https://www.linux.org/threads/why-use-wayland-with-xwayland.45125/post-192531
+ XWayland applications can appear blurry, especially on high-resolution displays, due to Xorgâ€™s inability to scale properly. This is a known issue.
+ Electron apps (e.g discord,chromimium-base-apps/browsers) run in XWayland mode by default, which can lead to blurriness.
+ Electron apps can also appear blurry when fractional scaling is enabled on Wayland. This is because the scaling process can result in applications not being rendered at the correct pixel density, leading to a blurry appearance


**Fixes**

+ Identify the application first. Search engines are free. Query for 'How to run Application XXX in Wayland?'. 
+ Run ``` hyprctl clients ```, find the package of interest and confirm if xwayland value is 1

> [!Important]
> Running apps natively on wayland should fix mostly all of the blur issues.

### Electron/Chromium 

##### Browsers (chrome/brave)

Open the browser >> navigate ``` chrome://flags/  ``` >> search for ``` Preferred Ozone platform ``` >> Select wayland 

##### Other Electron apps 

Take ``` Vs code ``` for example.
Be sure to exit all VS Code instance
Run ``` code --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland ``` 

> [!Caution]
> Add/remove this flag ```--disable-gpu ``` if sometimes the application becomes invisible

**How can I launch it on app launcher**

+ Find the .desktop entry using this handy command ```  find /usr/share/applications -name '*code.desktop'  ```
![image](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots/assets/53417443/93e7ead2-60c0-4767-82ab-000b581bb342)
+ You should copy then edit the .desktop entry of each application to ``` ~/.local/share/applications/ ```
+ Find the ``` Exec = ``` part then add the flags

> [!Note]
>Remember, if you're looking to edit or create a .desktop file, it's a good practice to place it in ``` ~/.local/share/applications/ ``` to avoid modifying system-wide files. This ensures that your changes are user-specific and do not require administrative privileges

This repo is not a Linux tutorial, so here is the [wiki on how to deal with .desktop entries.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries) 

## Xwayland(ðŸ‘¹)

Please navigate to the Hyprland wiki for the explanation. 
#### [XWayland](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/XWayland/) 

### Note that if the application does not support Wayland, HyDE, Hyprland and Wayland itself don't have powers to magically fixed the issue! Do not report this as an issue, try to open questions on the [Discussion panel](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots/discussions) for help.

## Known Issues

- Few scaling issues with rofi configs, as they are created based on my ultrawide (21:9) display.
- Random lockscreen crash, refer https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/7046
- Waybar launching rofi breaks mouse input (added `sleep 0.1` as workaround), refer https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/1850
